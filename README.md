## Information

Firefly is a lightweight graphical feature management module which allows the enabling and disabling of certain features to improve performance of the client all-the-while maintaining the set QualityLevel of the client (1-10).

With this module you are able to toggle the following features on/off either by using a graphics preset menu, a radio feature-toggle menu, or both! Firefly v1.0.0 can now correctly support the toggling of certain features after setting a graphics preset - it will not save this information however and will be overridden by a change in preset; this is intended behaviour and will not change.

So what are you able to currently toggle using Firefly?
- Materials,
- Post Effects,
- Textures,
- Atmosphere
- Lighting.GlobalShadows

There is no further planned support of additional features at this time unless requested.
